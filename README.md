Built as part of the Bob Ziroll's [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) Scrimba course.

I have also implemented a few additional features: 
- it looks good on smaller screens with two columns of 5 dice
- the dice have proper dice faces (aka dots)
- each die has a different color when held
- there is a timer showing how long it took you to win
- there is also a counter showing how many rolls it took you to win
- the app keeps track of best times and lowest # of rolls
- those best scores are saved to local storage, so they persist when the page is refreshed
- the code has been refactored in accordance with the ~~Holy Scriptures~~ Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
