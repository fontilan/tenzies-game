Built as part of the Bob Ziroll's [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) Scrimba course.

I have also implemented a few additional features: 
- the dice have proper dice faces (aka dots)
- each die has a different color when held
- there is a timer showing you how long it took you to win
- there is also a counter showing how many rolls it took you to win
